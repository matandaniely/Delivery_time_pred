# Course Project â€“ ML Ops - Delivery Time
Predict the time taken by the delivery person to deliver the food from the restaurant to the delivery location



### Problem Statement 
Predict the time taken by the delivery person to deliver the food from the restaurant to the delivery location. With the help of:
â€¢	Age of the delivery person (Delivery_person_age)
â€¢	Previous rating (Delivery_person_Rating)
â€¢	Distance between restaurant and delivery location (Restaurant/Delivery_location_longtitude/latitude)

Dataset: Delivery Time (Kaggle)
Features: 
ID	Delivery_person_ID	Delivery_person_Age	Delivery_person_Ratings	Restaurant_latitude	Restaurant_longitude	Delivery_location_latitude	Delivery_location_longitude	Type_of_order	Type_of_vehicle	Time_taken(min)

Project Type: Regression, and the target = Time_taken(min)

Course Project â€“ ML Ops: Delivery Time Prediction
Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict the time taken (in minutes) for a delivery person to deliver food from the restaurant to the customer.
This is a regression problem, where the target variable is:
 Time_taken(min)
Key features used for prediction:
â€¢	Delivery_person_Age â€“ Age of the delivery person
â€¢	Delivery_person_Ratings â€“ Previous rating of the delivery person
â€¢	Geolocation data:
o	Restaurant_latitude, Restaurant_longitude
o	Delivery_location_latitude, Delivery_location_longitude
â€¢	Type_of_order â€“ Type of food order
â€¢	Type_of_vehicle â€“ Type of vehicle used

Our Approach
1.	Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
o	Cleaned missing and invalid entries
o	Calculated distance between restaurant and delivery location using geopy
o	Encoded categorical features (Type_of_order, Type_of_vehicle)
2.	Model Training
o	Trained a Linear Regression model
o	Used MLflow to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts (models)
3.	CI/CD Integration
o	Implemented CI (Continuous Integration) with GitHub Actions to:
 	Automatically test and lint code upon each push
o	Implemented CD (Continuous Deployment) to:
	Automatically re-run the pipeline and upload new artifacts
	Triggered only if the CI workflow completes successfully
