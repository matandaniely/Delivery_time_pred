# Course Project – ML Ops - Delivery Time
Predict the time taken by the delivery person to deliver the food from the restaurant to the delivery location



### Problem Statement 
Predict the time taken by the delivery person to deliver the food from the restaurant to the delivery location. With the help of:
•	Age of the delivery person (Delivery_person_age)
•	Previous rating (Delivery_person_Rating)
•	Distance between restaurant and delivery location (Restaurant/Delivery_location_longtitude/latitude)

Dataset: Delivery Time (Kaggle)
